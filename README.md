MilesToGo
=========

I am working on this project to learn stuffs. I am using J2EE, MVC architecture for the implementation and Bootstrap for the Web pages designed.
I started it yesterday (8th Jan, 2014) and the idea is to make a website where the user can log his miles for various activities like Cycling, Running, etc. 

Tasks done till now -

Day 1. 8th Jan, 2014: A simple DB table was created, Entity and Session beans for it was created. A Data Object and a Business Client was created. A Servlet Controller redirects to right JSP files on click on navigation buttons. A view history jsp currently displays all the rows in the Database table. Little CSS styling was done for the JSP pages using Bootstrap.
